	<p>We will be using the UK Police API to retrieve crime information.  An API is an Application Program Interface, 
		where you can use queries to call functions to perform various tasks.</p>

	<p>Queries made to the UK Police API will be made using GET requests (we will not be sending
		any data to the API, so we will not be making POST requests).  A GET request is a request 
		made to retrieve data from a server.  The GET request will typically be a url with one or more
		key-value pairs attached to the url string.  An example query string would be
		<span class="codespan">http://www.url.com/api?key1=value1&key2=value2</span> (note: this example is fake).
		A request is made to the website url.com, a question mark is then added to the url, followed
		by one or more key value pairs, where keys and values are linked with an equal sign, and each
		key-value pair is linked with an ampersand (&).</p>

	<p>Since the UK Police API does not require any authentication, you will not need an API key to make requests
		to the UK Police API.</p>

	<p>We will be performing requests asynchronously, which means that when the server receives the sent data, a callback
		is received.  When the data is sent, once it is received, content can be returned to the page.</p>
	
	<p>This guide will focus on creating JavaScript code that will use information typed and selected in form fields to 
		create queries that will return back the data we wish to retrieve.  We will build this up as we go through
		the various categories of data on the UK Police server: police force data, crime data, neighborhood information, and 
		data for stops and searched.</p>
