	<h2 class="bodyHeader">Accessing Crime Information with a GET query string</h2>
	
	<p>We will now demonstrate how to use GET requests to retrieve crime data and street level crimes.  You can choose to
		search for crimes either around a specific point (in a 1 mile radius around a specific latitude and longitude), or within an area 
		(delimited by several points). You can also specify a date to look for street level crimes.</p>
	
	<p>We will perform a GET request to retrieve this data.  Let's say for example we want to look at street level crimes at a location with
		a latitude of 51, a longitude of 0.1, and a date of 2012-03. The query string will look like this:
		<span class="codespan">https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/all-crime?lat=51&lng=0.1&date=2012-03</span>.</p>
		
	<p>This kind of query string is structured as follows.  The site where this is being retrieved from is <span class="codespan">https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/all-crime</span>.
		A question mark connects this url with the query data - the key value pairs.  Each key and respective value is connected with an
		equal sign "=", and each key-value pair is connected by an ampersand (&).  In the example above, lat (latitude) = 51,
		lng (longitude) = 0.1, and the date equals 2012-03.</p>
		
	<p>You can also look at the street level crimes within a geographic area, where several geographic points (latitude and longitude pairs)
		are concatenated into a string, which looks like this: <span class="codespan">50,0:51,0.2:50.2,-1</span>, where each geographic point is
		separated by a colon.  This string will be the value, and <span class="codespan">poly</span> will be the key.  An example link
		would look like this (with the area and the date): <span class="codespan">https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/all-crime?poly=50,0:51,0.2:50.2,-1&date=2012-03</span>.
		
	<h2 class="bodyHeader">Using JavaScript to perform a GET Request</h2>

	<p>Now that you know how to construct query urls, we will begin writing code to specify values in a form and then use JavaScript to 
		retrieve this information with a GET request.  We will use a form so the user can choose either a geographic point or
		an area, and then the user can enter the location and date, and when a submit button is clicked, the street level crime data for
		that location will be returned.  The form will look like this:</p>
		
		<fieldset>
		<span class="codespan"><form method="GET">
		  Enter either a Latitude and Longitude or an area (with multiple latitudes and longitudes in the following format: "50,1:51,2:52,0.5"):<br />
		  <input type="radio" name="locType" value="latLong" checked>
		  Latitude: <input type="text" id="lat">
		  Longitude: <input type="text" id="lon"><br />
  	
		  <input type="radio" name="locType" value="gArea">  
		  Enter a geographic area: 
		  <input type="text" id="area"><br /><br />
  	
		  Enter a date (YYYY-MM): 
		  <input type="text" id="date"><br />
		  <input type="submit" id="crimesubmit" value="View Crime Information">
		</form></span></fieldset>
	
	<p>Here the user can specify a point or an area, as well as a date, and when the data 
		is entered, the user can submit the request. Once this is submitted, a query string
		will be made along with a GET request.</p>
	
	<p>We will begin the JavaScript code by adding an event listener to the "View Crime 
		Information" button.  We will first add an event listener to a function 
		that will then add an event listener to the submit button, with the following code: 
		<span class="codespan">document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', bindButton);</span></p>

	<p>Then within the "bindButton" function, add an event listener to the submit button 
		(in this instance, the button id is "forcessubmit"): 
		<span class="codespan">document.getElementById('forcessubmit').addEventListener('click', function(event) {});</span>
		Now when the button is clicked, the <span class="codespan">bindButton</span> function is run.</p>

	<p>Within this function, create a new HTTP request: <span class="codespan">var req = new XMLHttpRequest();</span>.
		This will make a request and either send or receive data.  In this case we will be receiving data (GET).<p>
	
	<p>Then, based on the form fields that were selected, the text entries will be pulled from
		the form and added to the query string.  For example, for the location point, the following
		code pieces together the url with the form data to perform a GET request asynchronously (which is why the third value is true):
		<span class="codespan">req.open("GET", "https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/all-crime?lat=" + la + "&lng=" + lo + "&date=" + da, true);</span>
		Using <span class="codespan">document.querySelector('input[name = "locType"]:checked').value;</span>
		we can determine what the key(s) will be for the location - "lat" and "lng" for the single
		point or "poly" for the geographic area.  Then <span class="codespan">document.getElementById</span>
		will get the data from the text boxes to use as the value(s) for the key(s).
		We will not be sending anything to the server for this request, so null will be sent: 
		<span class="codespan">req.send(null);</span>.  If there are no errors, we will then 
		load the results: <span class="codespan">if (req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400) {
                var response = req.responseText;
                document.getElementById('viewForces').textContent = response;
            }</span></p>
	
	<p>Check out the entirety of the code in the CodePen below.  In the CodePen, enter "51"
		for latitude and "0.1" for longitude, and "2012-01" for the date.  Then enter 
		"50,0:51,0.2:50.2,-1" for the geographic area, and use the same date:</p>
	
	<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-slug-hash="MyRPVa" data-default-tab="js" data-user="willijo4" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/willijo4/pen/MyRPVa/">Crimes1</a> by Josh (<a href="http://codepen.io/willijo4">@willijo4</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
	<script async src="https://assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

	<p>This will return the category of each crime, along with its location, date, and an id
		for the crime.  Notice in the form that if the Latitude and Longitude are selected, 
		then nothing can be entered into the area, and vice versa.  This functionality is added by
		the <span class="codespan">disableField</span> function, where the disabled attribute 
		of a checkbox is true (disabled) or false (not disabled) depending on which selection is made.  For example, 
		if the user chose to enter data into the geographic area box, then the <span class="codespan">disableField</span>
		function will check if this field is checked with the following code: <span class="codespan">if (document.getElementById('area').checked)</span>.  
		If so, the disabled status will be set to false, so that a location ID can be entered into the field: 
		<span class="codespan">document.getElementById('area').disabled = false;</span>.  
		The disabled status of the other text boxes will be set to true so no data can be entered into them.
		Only data entered into an enabled text box with the appropriate radio button selected
		will be used to create the query string.</p>

	<p>We are going to modify the form to allow the user options to view the outcomes of a 
		street level crimes or the crimes that happened at a particular location, where there 
		will be a radio button to choose which one.  Then the user can specify a location point, 
		an area, or this time a location id.</p>
	
	<p>The JS code will be a bit different here, because, based on the different combinations 
		of choices, a different URL with a different query string will be constructed.  For 
		example, if a user chooses Crimes at a Location, a latitude and longitude of 52,-1, 
		and a date of 2015-03, then the following URL will be constructed: 
		<span class="codespan">https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-at-location?lat=52&lng=-1&date=2015-03</span>.
		Try additionally to search using a Location ID of "885142" and a date of "2015-03" for 
		Street Level Outcomes.  Note that you cannot use an area for Crimes at a Location, only
		a location point or a location id can be used to see crimes at a location.</p>

	<p>You can construct and perform similar queries for <a href="https://data.police.uk/docs/method/crimes-no-location/">crimes with no location</a>, 
		<a href="https://data.police.uk/docs/method/crime-categories/">crime categories 
		for a date</a>, and the <a href="https://data.police.uk/docs/method/outcomes-for-crime/">outcomes for a specific crime</a>.  
		Open a CodePen and try to write some similar code for these queries.  We will continue 
		exploring more of the API, and while we haven't yet explored how to display JSON data 
		other than as raw data, we will do so in the next sections.</p>
